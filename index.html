    <h2>About the Community</h2>
    <p>
        Johnson County has long been a center of rural community, cooperation, and shared purpose. 
        Generations of families have worked side by side to ensure that neighbors never faced hardship alone. 
        The spirit of looking out for one another has always run deep here. That tradition didn't fade with the passing of time; if anything, it only grew stronger. 
        Today, that same sense of belonging and mutual respect continues to define who we are — not just as a community, but as neighbors, friends, and family. 
    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        The Johnson County Community Resource Hub is dedicated to connecting residents with the support and opportunities they need to thrive. 
        We believe that everyone deserves access to resources that can help them overcome challenges and improve their quality of life. 
        This website will pull together resources that demonstrate how deep this connection between one another runs. 
        It shows the networks of support, collaboration, and civic engagement that have been built over generations.
